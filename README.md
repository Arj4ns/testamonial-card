This is the project from the GreatFrontEnd challenges. 
I wanted to start working on these, because i figured they would be a good way to pad my github / portfolio with some projects, and also keep my skills up to par. 
There seems to be alot of room for experimentation, so I'm eager to play around with that. 
For example, I threw this tiny card together utilizing almost pure tailwind. 

Here's to hoping I learn some new stuff from these.
